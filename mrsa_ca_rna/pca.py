"""
Perform the PCA analysis on the formed matrix from import_data.py

To-do:
    Relearn PCA and SVD to confirm I know what I'm graphing
        and why. Also, get confirmation about what I'm
        hoping to show (differences diseases across genes?).
    Perform PCA only once since it is ordered (PC1 is the same at
        1 or 36 components) and then take subsets for graphs and
        calcs.
    Run PCA on longitudinal data that I wither find here or in
        import_data.
